# Testing Framework Decision

**Date**: June 30, 2025  
**Decision**: Continue using Testify  
**Status**: Approved

## Summary

After evaluating testing frameworks for gorev-mcpserver, we have decided to continue using **testify** as our primary testing framework.

## Key Factors in Decision

1. **Already Integrated**: Testify is already used throughout the codebase with 88.2% coverage
2. **Performance**: 152x faster execution than Ginkgo (0.0091s vs 1.386s for 100 tests)
3. **Go Idiomatic**: Aligns with Go's simplicity philosophy and standard testing package
4. **Low Overhead**: Minimal dependencies and learning curve
5. **Excellent IDE Support**: Full debugging capabilities with standard Go tooling

## Comparison Results

| Aspect | Testify | Ginkgo |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Test Execution Speed | ✅ 0.0091s | ❌ 1.386s |
| Current Integration | ✅ Already used | ❌ Would require rewrite |
| Learning Curve | ✅ Simple | ❌ Complex DSL |
| IDE Support | ✅ Excellent | ❌ Limited |
| Go Idiomatic | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| BDD Support | ❌ Basic | ✅ Full |

## Recommendations

1. **Keep testify** for all unit and integration tests
2. **Consider testify/suite** for shared test setups
3. **Use testify/mock** if more sophisticated mocking is needed
4. **Maintain table-driven test pattern** as currently implemented

## When to Reconsider

Only reconsider this decision if:
- Complex E2E testing scenarios emerge
- BDD-style acceptance tests become necessary
- Team grows and prefers BDD approach
- Performance ceases to be a concern

## Current Test Structure to Maintain

```go
// Continue with current pattern
func TestFeatureName(t *testing.T) {
    testCases := []struct {
        name    string
        input   interface{}
        want    interface{}
        wantErr bool
    }{
        // test cases
    }
    
    for _, tc := range testCases {
        t.Run(tc.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // test implementation using assert/require
        })
    }
}
```

This decision supports our goal of reaching 95% test coverage while maintaining fast, maintainable tests.
