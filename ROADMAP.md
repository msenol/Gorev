- ✅ **Manual everything** - Automation and smart suggestions added

##### ✅ Phase 1: Context Management (Completed)

- **New MCP Tools:**

  - ✅ `gorev_set_active(task_id)` - Set active task context
  - ✅ `gorev_get_active()` - Get current active task
  - ✅ `gorev_recent(limit=5)` - Get recent task interactions
  - ✅ `gorev_context_summary()` - AI-optimized session summary
- **Database Updates:**

  - ✅ New table: `ai_context` (active task, recent tasks, session data)
  - ✅ New table: `ai_interactions` (track AI-task interactions)
  - ✅ Add columns: `last_ai_interaction`, `estimated_hours`, `actual_hours`
- **Auto-State Management:**

  - ✅ Auto-transition to "devam_ediyor" when task accessed (AutoStateManager)
  - ✅ Auto-transition to "beklemede" after 30min inactivity
  - ✅ Parent task completion check when subtasks complete
  - 🔲 Git commit integration for status updates (Phase 3)

##### ✅ Phase 2: Natural Language & Batch Operations (Completed)

  - ✅ Relative references: "son oluşturduğum görev", "database görevleri"
  - ✅ Smart interpretation: "yarın yapalım" → son_tarih: tomorrow
- **Batch Operations:**

  - ✅ `gorev_batch_update([{id: "123", status: "completed"}, ...])` (BatchProcessor)
  - 🔲 `gorev_bulk_create([task1, task2, ...])` (future enhancement)
  - 🔲 `gorev_bulk_transition(ids[], new_status)` (can be done via batch_update)
- **AI Summary Dashboard:**

  - ✅ Current sprint overview with blockers (context_summary)
  - ✅ Suggested next actions based on priorities
  - ✅ Time tracking: estimated vs actual

##### 🔲 Phase 3: Smart Automation (Future Enhancement)
